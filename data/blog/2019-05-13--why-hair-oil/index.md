Caring and protecting our hair has been a practice since ancient times. As we go about our everyday lives, our hair is exposed to all kinds of harsh elements. This can dry out our hair, make it brittle and cause split ends. However, hair treatments can help combat such effects by replenishing the lipid layer on the surface of our hair and restoring shine for a healthier look. With all natural ingredients, such as almond, coconut, and vitamin E oils, paired with aromatic lavender or cedarwood essential oils, f(x) haircare aims to create a product that not only repairs damage but also a refreshing experience built to function for you.
