The Entrepreneurship Committee at Rho Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi, titled Rho Innovate, is a small committee that has a core passion of entrepreneurship. With the support of the chapter, we received a small loan to go out, research, develop, test, and bring to market a unique product of our choosing. 

This year, we wanted to focus on revamping an everyday product while supporting sustainability. Through using eco-friendly suppliers and utilizing recyclable materials, f(x) haircare was born! Our philosophy is _natural inputs = real output_. All of our ingredients and materials are responsibly sourced because we believe in the best care for all of our users as well as the community and environment.
